# Journal Prompt Compendium

## Start here!

This is a series of lists of journal prompts by organized category. You can access the masterlist by clicking [here](https://my.flowershow.app/@competent-hedgeho/journalpromptcompendium/Masterlist), or locating it in the sidebar. 

If you're having trouble deciding on a cateogory or a prompt, randomizers are very helpful! Two options are a [random number generator](https://numbergenerator.org/randomnumbergenerator) or a [dice roller](https://rolladie.net/). You can access them by clicking the hyperlinks on the names in the previous sentence, or on the masterlist and each prompt page.

### Prompt Ideas and Feedback!

Prompt ideas can be sent through [this github discussion "Prompt Ideas"](https://github.com/competent-hedgeho/journalpromptcompendium/discussions/1#discussion-8911968)

Feedback or recommendations for improvement (including prompts you don't think belong here!) can be sent through [this github discussion "Feedback"](https://github.com/competent-hedgeho/journalpromptcompendium/discussions/2#discussion-8912008)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*clicking the hyperlink will take you directly to the github discussion, but they can also be accessed through the repository for this page titled 'journalpromptcompendium' under competent-hedgeho*

Or if you're not comfortable sharing publicly either can be sent directly to me on discord @[competenthedgeho](https://discordapp.com/users/1283197254278058027)

### Downloading the lists

The lists are available to download in markdown(.md) in the repository "[journalpromptcompendium](https://github.com/competent-hedgeho/journalpromptcompendium)" on github. 

From there, they can be imported to anywhere that accepts .md files!

For me, they worked best in Obsidian [^1] and Anytype. When I tested, the Masterlist links worked as long as the corresponding prompt list file was also downloaded!

Notion will import the files but if you want to use the masterlist it needs to be relinked. 

If you choose to download them, you'll be able to edit and customize!

### Using the Randomizers

If you haven't used a random number generator/ online dice roller before, here's a couple of tips! The first thing you'll need to do is set a limit corresponding to the number of categories/prompts. For example, the masterlist has 27 categories. 

***On the dice roller, change the number of "sides," circled here:*** <img width="2012" height="1168" alt="diceroller-sidedcircled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07dfb6d7-ea4b-4ee9-ac36-8a19f38c9540" />

***On the random number generator, change the box on the right next to "and," circled here:***
<img width="2048" height="1040" alt="numgen-limitcircled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21e8e6e-c106-41fe-91b6-403c77260972" />

#### Next, get your numbers!!!

***On the dice roller, click either "go," "roll," or "start," circled here:***
<img width="2012" height="1168" alt="diceroller-rollingoptionscircled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1f7751-4bbb-44d0-a52c-df95f4108db3" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Note: using "start" will make a series of numbers cycle rapidly until you click "stop."*

***On the random number generator, click either "go," "roll," or "start," circled here:***

## Happy Journaling! 

[^1]: Obsidian has a plug in called "Dice Roller" available under community plug ins. This can be easily coded directly into the prompt masterlist and/or individual links using code `dice:1d#` surrounded by backticks, once the plug in is installed and enabled. # needs to be replaced by the number of prompts/categories (for example: 27 for Masterlist or 15 for Self Care).
