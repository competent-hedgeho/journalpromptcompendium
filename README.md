# Journal Prompt Compendium

## Start here!

This is a series of lists of journal prompts by organized category. You can access the masterlist by clicking [here](https://my.flowershow.app/@competent-hedgeho/journalpromptcompendium/Masterlist), or locating it in the sidebar. 

If you're having trouble deciding on a cateogory or a prompt, randomizers are very helpful! Two options are a [random number generator](https://numbergenerator.org/randomnumbergenerator) or a [dice roller](https://rolladie.net/). You can access them by clicking the hyperlinks on the names in the previous sentence, or on the masterlist and each prompt page.

### If you haven't used a random number generator/ online dice roller before, here's a couple of tips!

The first thing you'll need to do is set a limit corresponding to the number of categories/prompts. For example, the masterlist has 27 categories. 

***On the dice roller, change the number of "sides," circled here:***

***On the random number generator, change the box on the right next to "and," circled here:***

### Next, get your numbers!!!

***On the dice roller, click either "go," "roll," or "start," circled here:***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Note: using "start" will make a series of numbers cycle rapidly until you click "stop."*
